<h4><strong>IMPERIAL COLLEGE HEALTHCARE NHS TRUST</strong> had the
largest high-risk repairs backlog in 2022-23 (filtered to general acute
hospitals only) according to the most recent figures.</h4>
<p><strong>Eric Munro</strong>, director of estates and facilities at
the trust, said: “Much of our estate pre-dates the NHS – some of our
buildings are nearly 180 years old. We spend around £25 million a year
just to deal with the highest risk maintenance issues so that we can
stay operational and keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>“The only realistic way of properly addressing the maintenance
backlog is through the redevelopment of our sites, with a full rebuild
of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington our most pressing need. All three of
our main hospitals are included in the Government’s New Hospital
Programme and we are doing all we can to accelerate our schemes.”</p>
<p>Additional background information for editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have not identified any issues related to reinforced autoclaved
aerated concrete (RAAC).</li>
<li>Examples of high risk backlog: replacing and updating heating,
ventilation and power systems, lifts and building fabric (such as roof,
walls and floors etc) and upgrading electrical supplies. Much of this
infrastructure is past its recommended life span but is required to meet
growing demand and new technologies.</li>

<h4><strong>THE QUEEN ELIZABETH HOSPITAL KING’S LYNN NHS FOUNDATION
TRUST</strong> was among the 10 trusts with the largest high-risk
repairs backlog in 2022-23 (filtered to general acute hospitals only)
according to the most recent, published figures.</h4>
<p><strong>Paul Brooks</strong>, Director of Estates and Facilities at
the Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS Foundation Trust, said:
“The QEH is a Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (RAAC) hospital,
and we continue to invest national capital funding to maximise the
safety the Trust’s current building. Working with a skilled engineering
team, we have implemented an intense installation programme over the
past two years to create a steel and support structure to maintain the
safety of the roof, for our patients, visitors and staff.</p>
<p>“We appreciate it can be disconcerting for our patients and visitors
when they see building work taking place - teams across the Trust are
doing their utmost to keep disruption to a minimum. In May 2023 the
Government announced that the QEH had been added to New Hospital
Programme so as a Trust we are working at pace with enabling work to
bring a new hospital to King’s Lynn and West Norfolk by 2030.”</p>
<p><strong>In response to Rebecca’s experience, Paul Brooks, Director of
Estates and Facilities at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS
Foundation Trust, said:</strong></p>
<p>“We continue our rolling Reinforced Autoclaved Aerated Concrete
(RAAC) programme of installing steel and timber support props across the
hospital to maximise the safety of our buildings for our patients and
staff. We currently have 3,397 steel and timber support props across the
Trust. We appreciate these props and the work around the site can be
unsettling for patients. These measures are proactive steps to maximise
safety at our hospital. We are working with the national New Hospital
Programme team who are supporting us to find a long term solution.</p>
<p>“In January [2023] the Trust suffered a blockage in a drainage system
near to the West Wing area of the hospital. Our Estates team responded
immediately to clear the blockage and clean down the area. Monitoring of
the drainage system is carried out by the Estates team on a daily basis,
to prevent sewage leaks. Our hospital is in a semi-rural location, with
several sides surrounded by woodland. We have a local provider
responsible for our pest control which performs regular visits to audit
the site and responds on the same day to any reports to take immediate
action.”</p>

<h4><strong>LEEDS TEACHING HOSPITALS NHS TRUST</strong> was among the 10
trusts with the highest percentage increase in the cost of high-risk
repairs from 2021-22 to 2022-23, according to the most recent, published
figures.</h4>
<p><strong>Craige Richardson</strong>, Director of Estates and
Facilities, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said:</p>
<p>“The Trust, like many organisations across the NHS, has a significant
maintenance backlog, with large parts of our sites spanning as far back
as Victorian times. It’s not unusual to see movement when compared year
on year, especially across such a large/diverse estate.</p>
<p>“We have recently carried out a full, comprehensive survey of our
buildings across all sites, and as a result some elements were
re-graded. A large proportion of this increase was expected, and we have
plans in place to address it, either through investing in ‘greener
solutions’ or imminent building disposal.</p>
<p>“The safety of our patients, visitors and staff remains a priority of
the Trust.</p>
<p>“We have plans to halve the overall backlog maintenance at Leeds
Teaching Hospitals, through a new state-of-the-art hospital on the Leeds
General Infirmary site . The project is fully funded by the Government,
and we are currently awaiting the go ahead from the New Hospital
Programme to start construction. It will provide a new home for Leeds
Children’s Hospital, a new adults’ hospital and one of the largest
single-site maternity centres.”</p>

<h4><strong>BEDFORDSHIRE HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST</strong> was
among the 10 trusts with the highest percentage increase in the cost of
high-risk repairs from 2021-22 to 2022-23, according to the most recent,
published figures.</h4>
<p><strong>A spokesperson for Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation
Trust answered our questions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: Referring to your trust, can you tell me how this
high-risk repair bill has accumulated?</strong></p>
<p>A: “Our Trust estate is ageing with a number of high and significant
risks that can no longer proactively be managed. This is due to changes
in building regulations and compliance requirements, hyper-inflation
within the construction market, pressure on specialist resourcing in
terms of skill and capacity, as well as our estates being pushed to the
limit to support clinical activity, priorities and risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can your trust afford to complete these repairs? Have you
asked for help with these repairs? If so, from whom (eg government) and
what was the response?</strong></p>
<p>A: “Our Trust’s backlog stands at £193m and is growing, which we are
unable to afford to address. These risks are regularly reported via
local forums and the annual ERIC return. There is national recognition
that capital funding is inadequate, with limited funding opportunities
available to address high and significant risk.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Should patients be concerned to see these figures? What
would you say to them?</strong></p>
<p>A: The figures shown are concerning, however a schedule of high risk
backlog maintenance is rolled out on an annual basis, focusing on the
highest risks to clinical service provision.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What has caused the repair bill to increase by the
percentage it has at your trust from 2021-22 to 2022-23 – was that down
to a survey of your buildings in that time period for example? Has the
discovery of RAAC concrete played a role in the size of this repair bill
at your trust?</strong></p>
<p>A: This is caused by our ageing estate and the number of risks that
can no longer be proactively managed. As mentioned above, this is due to
changes in building regulations and compliance requirements,
hyper-inflation within the construction market, pressure on specialist
resourcing in terms of skill and capacity, as well as our estates being
pushed to the limit to support clinical activity, priorities and risk.
To date, no RAAC has been found in the Trust estate.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What solutions can you put in place before and in order
for these high-risk repairs can be carried out? How soon can those
repairs be carried out and what would the impact be on patients for
those repairs to be carried out eg necessary part-closure of the
hospital site? What impact would that have on patients? Is that
something about which you have already made patients aware if and when
repairs can be scheduled?</strong></p>
<p>A: “An annual programme of high risk maintenance is proactively
rolled out across the Trust Estate. Significant consideration is given
to the operational estate to ensure minimal impact on patient services
where possible. The estate would benefit from a substantial uplift in
capital funding to address estate risks and allow for the proactive
maintenance and upkeep.”</p>

<h4>LONDON NORTH WEST HEALTHCARE NHS TRUST was among the 10 trusts with
the largest high-risk repairs backlog in 2022-23 (filtered to general
acute hospitals only) according to the most recent, published
figures.</h4>
<p><strong>A spokesperson for London North West University Healthcare
NHS Trust answered our questions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: How has this high-risk repair bill
accumulated?</strong></p>
<p>A: “Northwick Park Hospital is now more than fifty years old, while
Ealing Hospital is approaching fifty. Despite ongoing regular
maintenance work, the ageing infrastructure on both sites presents a
significant challenge. In addition, modern healthcare requires
additional space, higher intensity of use, and a greater level of
engineering systems, requiring considerably more maintenance than would
have been the case when the sites were built. We have already invested
significantly to fix a number of these issues, including building a new
energy centre at Northwick Park to move away from steam, improving our
electricity generators for our secondary electricity supply, and
replacing or upgrading a range of other systems such as fire alarms,
water systems and medical gas supply mechanisms. However, other complex
systems, such as ventilation and lifts, continue to need substantial
work.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Have you asked for help with these repairs? If so, from
whom (eg government) and what was the response?</strong></p>
<p>A: “We bid for funding support from various sources, including from
capital funding from NHS England. Modernising and investing in new
facilities remains one of the most effective ways to reduce this kind of
backlog, and therefore this year we have already made some substantial
improvements to critical aspects of our estate, including important
refurbishment work to our maternity unit and birthing centre, and other
crucial site developments including the development of the community
diagnostic centre at Ealing and the acute medical unit at Northwick
Park.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Should patients be concerned to see these figures? What
would you say to them?</strong></p>
<p>A: “Our patients can be confident that we monitor any issues
associated with our sites very closely, and that we anticipate and
swiftly deal with any issue that could have an immediate impact on our
ability to provide care. This includes rigorous risk management,
governance and health and safety processes and reporting, which
ultimately are overseen by our board of directors.”</p>
<p><strong>Q: Has the discovery of RAAC concrete played a role in the
size of this repair bill at your trust?</strong></p>
<p>A: No.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What solutions can you put in place before and in order
for these high-risk repairs can be carried out? How soon can those
repairs be carried out and what would the impact be on patients for
those repairs to be carried out eg necessary part-closure of the
hospital site? What impact would that have on patients?</strong></p>
<p>A: “We have a long-term plan to address these repairs, but as with
any older hospital site, maintenance is an ongoing activity that
requires constant monitoring and updating. We work closely with our
partner trusts in north west London to minimise any impact on our
patients and communities and will always seek to minimise disruption to
our services. This means completing work in a phased and coordinated way
that allows healthcare to continue. Wherever possible, we align repairs
with other important improvements to our sites, as we are currently
doing with the community diagnostic centre at Ealing and hope to do by
developing a new critical care unit at Northwick Park.”</p>

Foundation Trust, said: “Our RAAC risks are well-known, and this figure
highlights the extent of the work being carried out to address the
structural issues at Airedale.</p>
<p>“Being on the New Hospital Programme means that we can now look
forward to a future in a RAAC-free hospital estate. But in the meantime,
we continue to take every step possible to maintain safety within the
building. This includes a comprehensive programme of rolling inspections
and putting in structural supports and installing structural solutions
where necessary.”</p>

<h4>WEST SUFFOLK NHS FOUNDATION TRUST was among the 10 trusts with the
largest high-risk repairs backlog in 2022-23 (filtered to general acute
hospitals only) according to the most recent, published figures.</h4>
<p><strong>Craig Black</strong>, executive director of resources for the
West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust, said:</p>
<p>“The safety of patients, staff, and visitors is our priority and we
have always followed expert, independent advice when it comes to the
management of our buildings.</p>
<p>“Due to our ageing estate and the prevalence of RAAC across much of
our West Suffolk Hospital site, we have undertaken a large programme of
remedial works to support our RAAC infrastructure and made improvements
in areas that include asbestos, ventilation and fire safety.</p>
<p>“As part of these works, which are well advanced and sit alongside
general maintenance, we continually address areas of ongoing concern and
do so as and when further risks are identified.</p>
<p>“In addition, we are a ‘priority site’ under the Government’s New
Hospital Programme and are on track to deliver a new healthcare facility
on Hardwick Manor in Bury St Edmunds by 2030.”</p>
<p>Background for editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Trust is well advanced in a programme of remedial works across
its West Suffolk Hospital estate to mitigate the risks associated with
RAAC (reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete), which has required
significant investment. Several safety measures to help manage the site
are in place including:
<ul>
<li>Regular survey and monitoring programme, assessing the condition of
RAAC planks. Increased surveillance is ongoing until the main hospital
relocates to a new site.</li>
<li>If an issue is found, remedial and mitigating work is undertaken
immediately and short-term, temporary props installed to reinforce the
plank.</li>
<li>Substantial additional precautionary measures: as of December 2023,
88% of RAAC roof planks have precautionary supports in place, the
majority of these are failsafe roof supports of steel and timber beams –
a support system being implemented across the hospital</li>
<li>A specific treatment scheme for wall panels is using zinc anode
technology to prevent further deterioration; 100% of the RAAC wall
panels have been treated.</li>
<li>There have been no plank failures at the West Suffolk Hospital.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To provide additional capacity and minimise disruption to patients
while the RAAC estate maintenance programmes have been ongoing, the
Trust designed and commissioned a decant ward.</li>
<li>The vast majority of the £65.7m repairs backlog is associated with
the remedial works undertaken to mitigate the risks associated with
RAAC, for which the Trust has received significant funding from the
government.</li>
<li>Due to the ageing estate, the West Suffolk Hospital site’s asbestos
works have been ongoing for many years and will continue to be a core
area of work now and in the future. A large amount of the asbestos works
have come under the Trust’s estates maintenance programme which
mitigates the risks associated with RAAC.</li>
<li>Continual remedial works and improvements have been made across the
estate’s fire safety requirements, which also sit alongside the estates
maintenance programme which mitigates the risks associated with
RAAC.</li>
<li>Much of the current high and significant risk ventilation works are
anticipated to be completed by summer 2024.</li>
<li>To Trust carries out a whole estate review every five years (20% of
the site assessed annually) to determine what it needs to do to maintain
its land and property to an accessible standard in line with best
practice. This annual review means the costs attributed to the backlog
change as works for the following year are identified. Therefore, the
size of the backlog can increase or decrease between years.</li>
<li>West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust is a ‘priority site’ under the
Government’s New Hospital Programme and is on track to deliver a new
healthcare facility on Hardwick Manor in Bury St Edmunds by 2030.</li>

<h4>OXFORD UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS NHS FOUNDATION TRUST was among the 10
trusts with the highest percentage increase in the cost of high-risk
repairs from 2021-22 to 2022-23, according to the most recent, published
figures.</h4>
<p><strong>Mark Holloway</strong>, Chief Officer for Estates and
Facilities at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said:
“Here at OUH, we are one of the largest Trusts in the country and have
four hospital sites, as well as other satellite properties.</p>
<p>“The uplift at OUH is as a result of a newer, detailed and more
targeted building condition survey. In terms of RAAC, a very small
amount was identified at the Churchill Hospital site in Oxford. Whilst
having established the level of risk, the identified RAAC is currently
safe and inspected regularly, however the Trust has been successful in
receiving national RAAC remedial funding and will be removing all
identified RAAC material from the hospital this year.</p>
<p>“Patient safety is our number one priority at the Trust, and
continual investments and improvements in our estate do not compromise
or impact patient or staff safety. It is our ambition to improve and
replace our oldest estate and make the best use possible of our more
modern buildings for the benefit of our patients and staff.”</p>
<p>Background for editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our approach to capital investment to reduce backlog maintenance is
prioritised on a risk-based approach, and we prioritise the areas in
greatest need.</li>

<h4>A spokesperson for UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS OF DERBY AND BURTON NHS
FOUNDATION TRUST, which was among the 10 trusts with the highest
percentage increase in the cost of high-risk repairs from 2021-22 to
2022-23 in its acute hospitals, sent us the following background for
editors, but not to be used as quotes.</h4>
<p>Please find below some background information that we hope is helpful
for factual accuracy in your reporting. Please treat this as background
rather than for us as quotes from the Trust.</p>
<ul>
<li>University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust (UHDB)
has five sites across two counties, with more than 14,500 staff. From
analysis we have done, we understand that the figures shared by the BBC
link to just one of our acute hospital sites, Queen’s Hospital Burton.
As a whole Trust, our High-Risk backlog maintenance in 22/23 was
£10,277,970, with £8,942,261 being for the Queen’s Hospital Burton
site.</li>
<li>Circa £6m of this Queen’s Hospital Burton backlog relates to work
around orthopaedic theatres on the site, and a feasibility survey is
underway to establish the full scope of these works. Patients who need
orthopaedic care continue to be treated safety while this is
underway.</li>
<li>Throughout 23/24, work has already taken place to address nearly
£1.5 million of high-risk backlog maintenance.</li>
<li>The year-on-year increase is due to a variety of factors, including
a formal review by external advisors who have updated figures to reflect
inflation and risk classification changes for some areas of work.</li>
<li>We prioritise areas which directly support patient care and clinical
activity, and conduct the work based on funds available within our
annual capital allocation. All of our estate is monitored and regularly
reviewed to ensure it is safe and appropriate for use by staff and
patients.</li>
<li>The Trust does not have RAAC in any of its sites. This has been
additionally verified through an independent survey.</li>

<h4>From a spokesperson for ASHFORD AND ST. PETER’S HOSPITALS NHS
FOUNDATION TRUST, which was among the 10 trusts with the highest
percentage increase in the cost of high-risk repairs from 2021-22 to
2022-23, according to the most recent, published figures.</h4>
<p><strong>Q: Referring to your trust, can you tell me how this
high-risk repair bill has accumulated?</strong></p>
<p>A: The % change is only sizable because of the very low starting
point from the previous year, and this backlog category for the Trust is
very low compared in a national perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can your trust afford to complete these
repairs?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>Q: Have you asked for help with these repairs? If so, from
whom (eg government) and what was the response?</strong></p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p><strong>Q: Should patients be concerned to see these figures? What
would you say to them?</strong></p>
<p>A: The risks in this backlog category are all manageable and will be
resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What has caused the repair bill to increase by the
percentage it has at your trust from 2021-22 to 2022-23 – was that down
to a survey of your buildings in that time period for example? Has the
discovery of RAAC concrete played a role in the size of this repair bill
at your trust?</strong></p>
<p>A: The figures in this category have been updated following a
conditions survey but still remain low. ASPH does not have a RAAC
problem.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What solutions can you put in place before and in order
for these high-risk repairs can be carried out?</strong></p>
<p>A: These repairs are being planned for as part of the capital
prioritisation planning programme</p>
<p><strong>Q: How soon can those repairs be carried out and what would
the impact be on patients for those repairs to be carried out eg
necessary part-closure of the hospital site? What impact would that have
on patients? Is that something about which you have already made
patients aware if and when repairs can be scheduled?</strong></p>
<p>A: These repairs relate to Estates infrastructure projects that can
be replaced without closing down critical patient services or affecting
delivery of patient services.</p>
