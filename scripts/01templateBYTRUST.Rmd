# `r trustproper`

The cost of general acute hospital repairs backlogs at `r boldtrustproper` has **`r change` `r gsub("-","",totalYOYchangePerc)`%** from £`r format(total_prev_yr, big.mark=",")` to £`r format(total_latest_yr, big.mark=",")` in the last financial year, according to analysis of [data released by NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/estates-returns-information-collection/england-2022-23).

The backlog of high-risk repair costs has`r comparator` `r changehc` **`r changePerc_highcost`** from £`r format(round(prev_highcost), big.mark=",")` to £`r format(latest_highcost, big.mark=",")`.

At a national level the high risk repairs backlog has risen more than a third in the last year to £2,078,970,702, while the overall repairs backlog has risen 8.7% to £9,509,161,437 (figures adjusted for inflation).

In 2022-23, there `r werewas` `r incidents23` “clinical service `r incidentplural` caused by estates and infrastructure failure,” `r incident_chgtype` compared to `r incidents22` such `r incidentplural22` in 2021-22.

Clinical service incidents are defined as those leading to "services being delayed, cancelled or otherwise interfered with owing to problems or failures related to the estates and infrastructure failure." An incident is "considered to be a delay of at least 30 minutes to clinical services affecting at least 5 patients or equivalent."

Incidents include problems with electrical, water or ventilation systems, internal fabric and fixtures, roofs and structures, or lifts and hoists. See the table at the bottom of this page for a list of the top three most impactful categories of incident reported by each hospital, where applicable.
